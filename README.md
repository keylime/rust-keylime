## Overview

This is a Rust implementation of
[python-keylime](https://github.com/mit-ll/python-keylime) from MIT Lincoln
Lab.  Keylime is system integrity monitoring system that has the following
features:

* Exposes TPM trust chain for higher-level use
* Provides an end-to-end solution for bootstrapping node cryptographic
  identities
* Securely monitors system integrity

For more information, see the original [python implementation repo](https://github.com/mit-ll/python-keylime)
and paper in the References section.

For now, this project is focusing on the keylime node component, which is a
HTTP server running on the server machine that executes keylime operations.
Most keylime operations rely on TPM co-processor; therefore, the server needs
a physical TPM chip (or a TPM emulator) to perform keylime operations.  The
TPM emulator is a program that runs in the deamon to mimic TPM commands.

## Prerequisite

**Rust** Make sure Rust is installed before running Keylime. Installation
instructions can be found [here]
(https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html).

**TPM** The `TPM4720` package is required to use Keylime.  It can be found at
[mit-ll/tpm4720-keylime]((https://github.com/mit-ll/tpm4720-keylime). `TPM4720`
supports systems that have physical TPM chips, and can also provide a TPM
emulator.

## Installation

**TPM4720 Emulator on Fedora-28** To install TPM4720, run the following script
to install TPM4720 in mit-ll/tpm4720-keylime
[repo](https://github.com/mit-ll/tpm4720-keylime) root directory as root to
install tpm emulator into you system.  We have tested it with Fedora 28; it
may or may not work with other environments.

```
$ cd scripts/
$ sudo bash install-fedora-28.sh
```

## Logging env

To run with `pretty-env-logger` trace logging active, set cargo run
within `RUST_LOG`, as follows:

    RUST_LOG=keylime_node=trace cargo run

## Testing

Unit tests are gating in CI for new code submission.  To run them:

```
$ cargo test
```
